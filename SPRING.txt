Spring

*** It is xml based configuration ***
1> ApplicationContext -> it is use for container creation also for the object creation of that for which we declare in bean in xml
2> .getBean("name which we mention in bin for this class")-> for accessing the object or declaring the object
3> object creation-> refer to spring 1
4> scope -> refer to spring 1
5> setter injection -> refer to spring 1
6> ref attribute -> refer to spring 1
7> constructor injection ->  refer to spring 1
8> creating interface -> refer to spring 1
9> primary bin -> refer to spring 1


ioc -> inversion of control control the business logic
spring ioc container -> container which have all the objects 
di-> there are three types of injection
1> setter injection
2> field injection
3> constructor injection 
Constructor injection
Uses the class constructor to provide dependencies. This is considered the recommended approach. 
Setter injection
Beans are not immutable, and missing dependencies can cause NullPointerExceptions. 
Field injection
Uses reflection, which can affect performance. This type of injection can be used in test classes.
